QR Code Generator

I made this program to generate multiple QR Codes, directly from a Text file, to a multiple page PDF. 
We need this PDF with one QrCode per page to use directly with In Design to create vAriable data layouts.  

You will find some demo Text files with their respective generated PDFs in the "samples" folder.

If you want just to use the program you can download the "dist" folder anyware in your windows computer 
or install it with the "qrcode_setup.exe" program. You can find it in the "Output" folder.
