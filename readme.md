QR Code Generator

I made this program to generate multiple QR Codes, directly from a Text file, to a multiple page PDF. So you can use a program like In Design to put a code in each different page.

You will find many Text files with their respective generated PDFs in the "samples" folder.

If you want just to use the program you can download the "dist" folder to your windows computer or install it with the "qrcode_installer.exe" program.
